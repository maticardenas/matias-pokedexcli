# Pokedex CLI

This is a CLI application developed with learning process, as part of the backend developer roadmap of [boot.dev](https://www.boot.dev/tracks/backend)

# Commands

- `help` -> Retrieve a list of commands
- `map` -> Retrieve a list of locations
- `map-back` -> Goes back on listed locations*
- `explore {location}` -> Retrieve a list of pokemons in a location
- `catch {pokemon}` -> Catches a pokemon
- `inspect` -> Retrieves information of a catched pokemon
- `pokedex` -> Retrieves a list of catched pokemons
- `exit` -> Exits the application

*The application makes usage of [Pok√©API](https://pokeapi.co/) to retrieve the list of pokemons and locations, when using `map` and `map-back` commands results as cached to avoid multiple requests to the API and improve the performance of the application.

```shell
$ map
```

Output:

```shell

```
